# Note about pip and wheel builds:
#
# - opencv-python (or its companions opencv-contrib-python, opencv-python-headless
#   and opencv-contrib-python-headless) is the pip package providing opencv:
#   when installed it comes with a dll, or an .so file (cv2.abi3.so)
#
# - when building wheels for macos and linux, the env variable
#  IMGUIBUNDLE_OPENCV_FETCH_SOURCE is set before running pip.
#  This way, a static minimal version of opencv will be linked into _imgui_bundle.so.
#  Thus there is no risk of doubly defined functions:
#     imgui_bundle will search into the linked functions inside _imgui_bundle.so,
#     and opencv-python and co will search inside cv2.abi3.so.
#
# - when building wheels for windows, the env variable
#   IMGUIBUNDLE_OPENCV_WIN_USE_OFFICIAL_PREBUILT_460 is set before running pip.
#   This way, an official release from OpenCV 4.6.0 for windows will be downloaded.
#   It includes an "opencv_world.dll" (a dll that groups all the code for all OpenCV modules).
#   This dll is deployed into imgui_bundle package (under windows)
#   No warning about doubly defined function was (yet?) observed, although a static link
#   might be needed in the future.
#   "Funny" note on how to set this env var under windows: choose your poison
#     * with PowerShell
#	      Set-Item -Path 'Env:IMGUIBUNDLE_OPENCV_WIN_USE_OFFICIAL_PREBUILT_460' -Value 'ON'
#     * With bash:
#	      export IMGUIBUNDLE_OPENCV_WIN_USE_OFFICIAL_PREBUILT_460=ON
#      * With dos:
#         set IMGUIBUNDLE_OPENCV_WIN_USE_OFFICIAL_PREBUILT_460=ON
